## Card Builder

The Card Builder is a lightweight JS tool that transforms dataset documentation that has been written in markdown into interactive Data Cards for the web. Data Cards that follow the [Telescopic-Periscopic-Microscope structure](https://datacardsplaybook.googleplex.com/foundations/optics) are rendered in a three-column layout, and each row is nested in accordians to help readers easily navigate complexities and nuances in dataset documentation.
[Hands on demo](https://pair-code.github.io/datacardsplaybook/labs)
Use the Card builder to create your interactive Data Cards that can be published on the web.
