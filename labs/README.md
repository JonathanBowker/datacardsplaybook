## Card Builder

The Card Builder is a lightweight JS tool that transforms dataset documentation that has been written in markdown into interactive Data Cards for the web. Data Cards that follow the [Telescopic-Periscopic-Microscope structure](https://datacardsplaybook.googleplex.com/foundations/optics) are rendered in a three-column layout, and each row is nested in accordians to help readers easily navigate complexities and nuances in dataset documentation.

Use the Card builder to create your interactive Data Cards that can be published on the web.
